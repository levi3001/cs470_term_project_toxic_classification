# cs470_term_project_toxic_classification
This is our implementation for CS470 Introduction to Artificial Inteligence term project. \
To reproduce the colab note book, you need to download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data and load it in the drive. The data path to the dataset after you mount to drive should be drive/MyDrive/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge.zip\
There are 5 colab notebooks corresponding to our implementation of LSTM, CNN, BERT, RoBERTa, GPT2 to address this problem
